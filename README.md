# Youtube-Channel-Search

### Motivation :
Youtube Channels are not sorted by dates when you search in them , with this script we can do that!

### How to use?
1. Clone the project
2. npm i on the root
3. inside index.js replace `runPuppeteer("<Name of channel>", "<Search query>");` example `runPuppeteer("@DevoxxForever", "kotlin");`
4. run index script
5. there will be json and html file related to your search sorted by time
